# CryptoCurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is the create a report for an investment bank interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The report includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. In order to complete this project, I am performing unsupervised machine learning functions on data provided by CryptoCompare.

A new bank is interested in offering crypto currencies to its customers. We are to analyze a lot of crypto currencies currently trading on the market how we can group them together using PCA and classify them to help formulate this new investment. 

## Results

we had to fit and scale the data so machine learning models could use it. We filtered down the currencies to ones that are currently trading, have coins that have been mined. We then made a 3d dot plot to see how the currencies get grouped together based on it's algorithm. Then a 2d scatter splot to show current supply to coins yet to mined and added to the supply.

## Summary

There are 4 different clusters as we asked for in the machine learning model. There are 2 clusters that varied outside of the large grouping of the rest of crypto currencies. This could either indicate over performance or underperformance. The scatter plot also indicates that most currencies currently traded already have around 40% of their total supply already available with most of it yet to mined.
